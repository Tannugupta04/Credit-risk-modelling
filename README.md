# 📌 Credit Risk Modelling – Machine Learning Project

## 🔍 Overview
An end-to-end **Credit Risk Classification system** that predicts customer risk levels (**P1–P4**) using demographic, behavioral, and financial data.  
The model helps financial institutions make **data-driven loan approval decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Classify customers into credit risk categories  
- Improve loan approval accuracy  
- Build a **production-ready ML pipeline**

---

## 🧠 Approach
- Cleaned and merged multiple datasets  
- Performed **statistical feature selection**:
  - Chi-Square Test (Categorical features)
  - ANOVA & VIF (Numerical features)
- Applied **Ordinal Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**
- Trained and evaluated:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - **XGBoost (Final Model)**

---

## 🏆 Model Performance
- **XGBoost** achieved the best accuracy and generalization
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score (class-wise)

---

## 🔮 Unseen Data Prediction
- Ensured same preprocessing and feature order
- Predicted customer risk categories (**P1–P4**)
- Exported predictions to **Excel** for business use

---

## 💾 Deployment Ready
- Final trained model saved as **Pickle (.pkl)**
- Can be deployed using:
  - REST API
  - Web Application
  - EXE / Batch Prediction
